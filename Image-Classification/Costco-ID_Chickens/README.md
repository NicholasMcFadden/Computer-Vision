# Identifying Costco Chickens w/ Template Matching

Initial project using images of Costco rotisserie chickens as templates to identify/match the template within a new image. The images will be a picture of the entire rack onto which Costco places its completed chickens. This is a simple project and only identifies the exact image as a template within the new image. Only finds itself within test image.
